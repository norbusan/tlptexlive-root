	Usage of GNU FreeFont

Language scripts and faces
==========================

There are three faces (serif, sans-serif, and monospace), and four styles
(regular, bold, cursive/italic, and bold cursive/italic) for each face.
There is one font file per face/style combination: 12 files in total.

The letters for various languages, as well as specialized symbols, exist
among the various font files, but they are not uniformly populated.
All the fonts have complete support for Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek, as
well as most of the extensions for those scripts.

At this time, serif regular has by far the largest number of letters, and
supports the largest number of writing scripts.  However there are writing
scripts supported by the sans-serif but not by serif.

For an overview of which scripts and sets of symbols are supported by
which face, see the FreeFont 'coverage' web page.

Font features
=============

FreeFont has numerous font "features" that perform alterations to the basic
letters of the font, replacing them with other letters, or positioning them
with respect to other letters.

Many features are activated automatically, but in some environments, they
present some user control.  This documents those features with user control.

Language-specific features
==========================

Some OpenType font features are activated only when the text is specified to
be of a certain language. 

This is done in HTML by enclosing the text with a tag whose 'lang' attribute
is set to the appropriate ISO 632.2 language code.  In a word processor, 
any block of text can be given a language setting.

Latin
-----
Catalan	ligature improving l·l
Dutch	ligatures for ij, IJ
Sami	localized form for letter Eng
Turkish	overrides ligatures fi ffi of Latin
Vietnamese	fine positioning stacked accents.  See also below.

Greek
-----
Greek	script kappa in serif and hooked Upsilon throughout;
	script forms of theta and rho in italic.
	ancient Greek caps iota in ypogegrammeni form.
	(see also character variants.)

Cyrillic
--------
Ukrainian	ligature for double i-diaresis
Serbian/Macedonian	localized form of 'be', and others in italic
	[the 'sha' with line below is available as a character variant ]
Bulgarian	style set for modern alternative glyphs

Hebrew
------
Yiddish	raised vowels under yo

Devanagari
----------
Sanskrit	much larger set of ligatures
Nepali, Kokani
Marathi
Santali
Gujarati

'hist' feature	 [optional historic ligatures: for ligatures of Old Hindi]

Malayalam
---------
Both the classical and reformed scripts are supported.  The default 
is the classical script.  The reformed script is enabled by setting the
OpenType language tag 'MLR '.

Indic languages
---------------

The 'danda' character is encoded in Unicode only in the Devanagari range.
When writing in scripts of other Indic languages, this same character is to
be used.  But the shapes and line thicknesses of glyphs vary slightly from
one script to another, so the same glyph for 'danda' may not fit all scripts.
Likewise, the spacing of Western punctuations marks is usually wider in 
Indic typography.

By specifying the language of the text, an appropriate glyph for 'danda'
may be obtained, and Western punctuation may be better spaced.

Style sets
==========

These replacements are meant to indicate variant typgraphic style, and
are activated by enabling a "Style Set" in the document.

Greek Extended	Adscript iota on capitals (ss06)

Cyrillic	Bulgarian modern (ss01)

Devanagari	Bombay (ss02), Calcutta (ss03), Nepali (ss04)

Tamil	Reformed orthography (ss07)

Character variants
==================
These are uaually a replacement for a single letter with another.

Greek: (Some of these are done already by the default 'locl' feature,
	and are useful only when that feature is disabled);
	script kappa (cv01);
	script beta except initial and isolated forms (cv02);
	script theta initial (cv03); script theta throughout (cv04);
	sigma lunate (cv05)
	final sigma lunate (cv06)
	small cap ypogrammeni iota (cv07)

Cyrillic: in italic faces, Serbian/Macedonian underscored 'sha' (cv01)

Tamil: form of 'ra' invariant with vowel marks (cv01).

Discretionary features
======================
These features are accessible only from typesetting software.
Typically the user must specifically request them.

Unless otherwise noted, these are available only in FreeSerif.

Ligatures and substitutions
---------------------------

Arabic, Armenian, Hebrew, German, Dutch, Spanish
Bengali (in Sans)

Stacked accents
---------------

In the Latin ranges, there are a number of characters with one accent
upon another.  These cause typographical difficulties.

Especially in the Vietnamese range, for some purposes it is best for these
accents to stand high above the letter, but for others, it is best that 
they remain within the line bounds.

By default, the accents stand high, exceeding vertical line bounds,
although this may cause clipping and refresh issues in some applications. 
A second set of glyphs, with "flattened" accents that keep inside the
vertical line bounds, may be had by enabling the 'flac' feature.

Small captials
--------------

A limited set of specially drawn small capital letters in Latin.

Superscript and subscript
-------------------------

Transform a limited set of characters--mostly Latin letters and numerals--
to versions well-sized and positioned as superscript or subscript.

Numeral styles
--------------

The default numerals of FreeSerif are mono-spaced and of even height.
It also features proportionally-spaced numerals, and "old-style" numerals--
those which vary in height and sometimes go beneath the baseline.
These can be had at discretion.

Diagonal fractions
------------------

A limited set of diagonal fraction substitutions are available at discretion.
The set is more than what is encoded in Unicode.
They work with the ASCII slash or the mathematical slash U+2215.
The transform a sequence "number-slash-number" to a diagonal form.

Zero
----

A slashed form of the numeral zero is available at discretion.
Available in all faces.

Alternative characters
======================

FreeSerif has some listings of alternatives for specific characters.
Again these are used primarily by specialized typesetting software.

	Greek, Latin

This face also has also a listing of ornamental versions of punctuation 
marks such as bullets and stars (ornm).

Use in HTML with CSS
====================
Some web browsers have lately become very typography-savvy, having long
outstripped word processors in this regard.

In basic HTML, it is most important to properly specify the langugage of
each text element, using HTML 'lang' attributes.  Many typographic
features of the font will be activated only for certain languages.

If the whole document is in English, for example, the attribute 
	lang="en-US"
in the <html> element will suffice.  Any sub-element can be given a 
separate language when needed.

With CSS, the "font-family" property can be specified as one of
	'freeserif', 'freesans' or 'freemono',
and several other properties influencing typographic presentation can
also be set: "font-weight", "font-style", etc.
In CSS 3, a special property 'font-feature-settings' that gives explicit
control of OpenType font features was introduced.  Several browsers
now have experimental implementations of this feature.  For example,
Mozilla Firefox has "font-feature-settings"; see
	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-feature-settings

These explicit features are specific to particular fonts.  So this 
technology is meant to work with "web fonts", a means of delivering
a font with your web page.  See the document "webfont_guidelines.txt"
for more information about this.

Use in LaTeX
============
It is possible to use Unicode fonts in recent LaTeX implementations, but in
	LuaTeX http://www.luatex.org/ and
	XeTeX http://tug.org/xetex/
it is particularly easy to use Unicode text, and to enable font features.
Recent versions of these systems use the 'fontspec' package to choose fonts
and features.

LuaTeX note: for lualatex to search the local font directory ~/.fonts/f,
the OSFONTDIR variable may be set, either in the luatex config files
or as an environment variable, e.g.
	export OSFONTDIR=/home/swhite/.fonts/f//

A LaTeX (.tex) document in these implementations might contain the lines:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\documentclass{ltxdockit}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont[]{FreeSerif}

\newfontfamily{\altbg}[Script=Cyrillic,Language=Bulgarian,
Variant={1}]{FreeSerif}
\newfontfamily{\altsb}[Script=Cyrillic,Language=Serbian,
ItalicFeatures={Script=Cyrillic, Language=Serbian, Style=Alternate},
BoldItalicFeatures={Script=Cyrillic, Language=Serbian, Style=Alternate} ]
{FreeSerif}

\begin{document}
{\fontspec[Script=Default,Fractions={On}]{FreeSerif}
1/7 3/10 7/10}

x\raisebox{-0.5ex}{{\scriptsize ai}}
x{\fontspec[Script=Default,VerticalPosition={Inferior}]{FreeSerif}
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz+−(0123456789)} \\
x\raisebox{0.85ex}{{\scriptsize ai}}
x{\fontspec[Script=Default,VerticalPosition={Superior}]{FreeSerif}
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz+−(0123456789)}

{\fontspec[Script=Latin]{FreeSerif}
\textsc{Small Caps} }

{ Bсички хора се раждат свободни и равни по достойнство и права.

\altbg
Bсички хора се раждат свободни и равни по достойнство и права.  }

\altsb{
Oнa су oбдaрeнa рaзумoм и свeшћу и трeбajeдни прeмa другимa дa пoступajу у духу брaтствa. 

\textit{
Oнa су oбдaрeнa рaзумoм и свeшћу и трeбajeдни прeмa другимa дa пoступajу у духу брaтствa. 
}
}

\end{document}

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some character ranges do not have 'italic' or 'oblique' versions.

To produce slated text in such ranges, 'fontspec' has features FakeSlant
and AutoFakeSlant.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use with unicode-math TeX package
=================================

FreeSerif and FreeSans have some support for the TeX package unicode-math
package (or any other software that uses the OpenType MATH tables).
By this means, math formulas may be displayed using the fonts.

FreeSerif further includes the Unicode Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols
range in its Roman face, so that it is possible to typeset a whole math
document using only FreeSerif-normal.

In XeTeX and LuaTeX, the primary commands are
	\usepackage{fontspec}
	\usepackage{unicode-math}

XeTeX is aware of the locations of system fonts:
	\setmainfont[]{FreeSerif}
	\setmathfont[]{FreeSerif}
In LuaTeX, the paths must be explicitly stated, for example:
	\setmainfont[Path=FONT-DIR-FULL-PATH] {FreeSerif}

It is possible to either use FreeSerif italic for the main math symbols font
	\setmathfont[Path=FONT-DIR-FULL-PATH, range=\mathit] {FreeSerifItalic}
or else to use the built-in math alphanumeric symbols ranges
	\setmathfont[Path=FONT-DIR-FULL-PATH, range=\mathit] {FreeSerif}
Other ranges are listed in the unicode-math.
